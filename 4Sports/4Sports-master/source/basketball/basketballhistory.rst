The History of Basketball
=========================


The Inventor of Basketball was Dr. James Naismith, what became the sport we know as basketball started as a child's game that Dr. Naismith used to play as a kid in Ramsay Township, Ontario, Canada. Kids tried to knock a “duck” off of a large rock with a smaller rock. He attended McGill University. In 1891 he ended up in Springfield, Massachusetts at a YMCA. He tried to create a sport that could be played indoors during the winters and used skill instead of just strength. It started with a soccer ball as the playing ball and two peach baskets. The sport grew in popularity and now Basketball is an Olympic sport. For men it has been an Olympic sport since 1936. For women it has been an olympic sport since 1976.
