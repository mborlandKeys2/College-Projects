The History of Football
=======================

Origins
-------
Football originated in universities. It is closely related to soccer and rugby, and the first game was played in 1869 in New Jersey between Princeton and Rutgers. This was not the same game that we know today. It was the beggining of the creation of football though. Walter Camp, known as the "Father of American Football", introduced many of the rules that converted the game from a rugby like game to modern day football. 

The National Football League
----------------------------
The NFL finds it's roots in 1920. 11 professional football clubs collectively formed a league known as the American Professional Football Association. This organization was created to cease bidding wars between clubs and to create a structure for the organization. In 1922 the league was renamed the National Football League. For some time professional football was overshadowed by college football, but it started to gain popularity in 1925. In 1960 the NFL had a rival league called the AFL. After issues arose between the two leagues they negotiated a merger agreement. The first Super Bowl was held in 1967 with the Green Bay Packers of the NFL defeating the Kansas City Chiefs of the AFL 35-10. Green Bay quarterback Bart Starr was named MVP.
