The History of Baseball
=======================
The history of baseball is somewhat complicated. There is a widely knows story of a civil war hero named Abner Doubleday,
who "created" baseball before the civil war. This never happened and the story was crafted in the 1930's to give simple answer to who created baseball.
Baseball finds its roots in a game far older than it; cricket. During the American Revolution, people across America were adapting Cricket to fit
a more simple gameplay. In 1845 the very first baseball team was founded; the New York Knickerbocker Baseball Club. One of the members, Alexander Joy Cartwright, 
would later put in place the rules we still use in baseball to this day. 

From 1900 to 1919, baseball was at its low point. Games were very low scoring due to the skill of some amzing pitchers at the time.
Baseball clubs didn't have a lot of money, and baseballs at that time cost $3 to make; a hefty $65 dollars in today's economy.
Balls were used for whole games to save money and by the end of it, would be mishapen due to being hit so many times.
Though this was Baseball's low point, many of the greatest players to ever be in baseball played during this time, such as Honus Wagner or Cy Young.

Baseball has since become a great American passtime, and is still thought by many as America's greatest sport.
